// Welcome to Cypress!
//
// This spec file contains a variety of sample tests
// for a todo list app that are designed to demonstrate
// the power of writing tests in Cypress.
//
// To learn more about how Cypress works and
// what makes it such an awesome testing tool,
// please read our getting started guide:

    // In addition to using the `get` command to get an element by selector,
    // we can also use the `contains` command to get an element by its contents.
    // However, this will yield the <label>, which is lowest-level element that contains the text.
    // In order to check the item, we'll find the <input> element for this <label>
    // by traversing up the dom to the parent element. From there, we can `find`
    // the child checkbox <input> element and use the `check` command to check it.
    cy.visit('/login', {failOnStatusCode: false});

    // Now that we've checked the button, we can go ahead and make sure
    // that the list element is now marked as completed.
    // Again we'll use `contains` to find the <label> element and then use the `parents` command
    // to traverse multiple levels up the dom until we find the corresponding <li> element.
    // Once we get that element, we can assert that it has the completed class.
    cy.get('input#username');
